## Mechanical Rain ##

This code is designed for an Arduino Uno with the Arduino Stepper Shield.

There is a 12V 2A NEMA 17 stepper motor attached to the shield.

The code is designed to raise and lower an object attached to a wire wrapped around a spool on the stepper motor. The code is supposed to work like a yo-yo with the acceleration and deceleration as the object nears the edges.
